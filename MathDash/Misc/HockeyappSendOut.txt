Hello!

Try out Math Dash on an android! I'm using Hockeyapp to distribute this and keep you all updated on versions.  To get it working, please follow the instructions Hockeyapp provides - mostly install Hockeyapp first and then install "MathDash" from the their app.  If you have any problems (or questions, or suggestions, or anything) please email me.

The config files are located at: /sdcard/Android/data/com.DrexelResearch.MathDash/files/
The equations2.json file contains a list of equations that will be played.  Description of variables:
solution - solution of equation (on right hand side)
operator - operation to be done, represented by an int.  0=+,-=1,*=2,/=3

Let me what you want me to work on next (timer, smarter bubble spawning?),
